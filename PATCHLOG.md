# PATCHLOG
- Added snapshot script (npm run snapshot) for frozen zips inside repo.
- Introduced UI kit: Badge, StatCard, Table (token-only).
- Dashboard now uses StatCard.
- Portfolio pages left as-is for data continuity; will migrate to `Table` component next.
- Sidebar implementation locked with hierarchical navigation structure.
- Applied bulletproof sidebar rebuild with hover expand and pin functionality.
- Restored full navigation hierarchy with Section > Group > Leaf structure.
- Fixed child icon visibility in collapsed mode with proper CSS positioning.
