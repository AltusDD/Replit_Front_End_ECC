1) Final acceptance (copy–paste checks)

Run these in any shell to confirm the 4 critical paths in one shot:

BASE="https://empirecommandcenter-altus-staging.azurewebsites.net"
echo "entities/properties:" && curl -s -i "$BASE/api/entities/properties?select=id,name&limit=1" | head -n1
echo "owners/search:" && curl -s -i "$BASE/api/owners/search?q=a" | head -n1
echo "owners/transfercontext:" && curl -s -i "$BASE/api/owners/transfercontext?sourceOwnerId=1" | head -n1
ADMIN="<your VITE_ADMIN_SYNC_TOKEN>"  # paste from Replit Secrets
echo "owners/approvetransfer (with token):" && curl -s -i -X POST "$BASE/api/owners/approvetransfer" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN" -d '{"transferId":123}' | head -n1


UI smoke:

/portfolio/properties/<real-id> → Asset Card shows counts + address

/owners/transfer → search → Initiate → Approve → Authorize → Execute (the last 3 require the admin token present in .env)

If anything is off, tell me which line and I’ll give the single command to fix it.

2) Demo script (10 minutes, no surprises)

Owners → Transfer: search source “a”, target “b”, Initiate → Approve → Authorize → Execute

Portfolio → pick a property row → Asset Card shows Units / Active Leases / Tenants + address

Hard refresh → repeat one GET to show it’s truly live

Keep DevTools Network open; point at the 200 OK responses.

3) Hardening (quick wins today)

Access & secrets

Rotate the admin token before sharing broadly (you can use the same deploy script to mint a new one). Put it only in Replit Secrets, not code.

Add a simple check to reject non-POST on admin endpoints (idempotent safety).

Observability

Turn on Application Insights (if not already): request/exception sampling and live metrics.

Enable Azure log retention ≥ 14 days.

Security

CORS: restrict to your Replit frontend origin(s) on the Function App.

Consider authLevel: function for admin routes with a function key (or keep header-token for now; it’s fine for staging).

Stability

Keep “hyphenectomy” (underscored function folders) — avoids indexer edge cases.

Keep vendored deps in .python_packages + WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE=1 for deterministic runtime.

4) Runbook (copy into your team docs)

Deploy (staging)

In ecc-backend-deployer: ./deploy.sh

If Azure CLI is flaky → use Kudu ZipDeploy with the vendor zip.

Verify: ./verify.sh (or the 4-line curl above)

Rotate admin token

# in deploy.sh path
./deploy.sh   # script prints new token
# update Replit frontend secret: VITE_ADMIN_SYNC_TOKEN
# hard refresh app / redeploy frontend


Rollback

Re-ZipDeploy last known good vendor zip via Kudu.

Or set WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE back to the previous URL if you’re using storage package references.

5) Frontend polish (fast, visible wins)

Add skeletons/spinners to Asset Card + Transfer page (you already have basic “Loading…”; optional: shimmer).

Toast errors (network status) so failures are obvious to non-devs.

On successful Execute, show a green confirmation with the transferId.

If you want, I’ll drop a single paste to add a tiny toast helper and skeleton loaders—just say the word.

6) Next targets (to look great tomorrow)

Property list → detail navigation polish (breadcrumbs + back)

Search UX: live suggestions as you type (debounced calls to /owners/search)

Metrics card on dashboard pulling counts from /entities/*?select=count style queries

Theme pass: tighten spacing, consistent card heights, and responsive grid at md/lg

You asked for CTO energy. You’ve got it. The system is up, the UI is talking to it, and you’ve got a clear, boring-reliable path to deploy, verify, and demo. If you want those skeletons/toasts or a one-liner to rotate the token now, say the word and I’ll hand you the paste.
