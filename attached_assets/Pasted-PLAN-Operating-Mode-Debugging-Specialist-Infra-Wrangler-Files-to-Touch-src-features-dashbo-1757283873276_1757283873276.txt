Files to Touch: 
- `src/features/dashboard/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`
Guardrails: 
- This task is exclusively for implementing the correct data transformation logic within the hook.
- Do not modify any UI components.
- All calculations must follow the logic defined in the "Genesis Grade" brief.

CHANGESET
- **File: `src/features/dashboard/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`**
  1.  **Implement Correct Occupancy Calculation:**
      - The current calculation is failing because `unit.status` is null. You must replace it with the logic from the project brief.
      - After fetching `leases` and `units`, create a function to determine the true occupied count.
      - Logic: An occupied unit is one that has a lease where `lease.status === 'active'` and the current date is between `lease.start_date` and `lease.end_date`.
      - Use this new function to calculate the values for the "Occupancy" and "Rent Ready" KPIs.

  2.  **Gracefully Handle Missing Map Coordinates:**
      - In the section that transforms properties into `mapData`, add a check for `property.latitude` and `property.longitude`.
      - If these fields are missing, log a specific warning to the console for that property: `console.warn('Property "${property.name}" is missing coordinates and will not be displayed on the map.')`
      - The `mapData` array returned by the hook should only contain properties that have valid coordinates. If none have coordinates, it should be an empty array.

  3.  **Confirm Maintenance Join Logic:**
      - No new code is needed, but verify that the existing logic correctly joins the live `workorders` array with the `properties` array to include the full property address in the final `feedData`.

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
- The "Occupancy" KPI in the UI now shows a correct, non-zero percentage calculated by cross-referencing the `leases` and `units` arrays.
- The "Rent Ready" KPI is also showing a correct, calculated value.
- The map on the UI remains empty, but the developer console now contains clear warnings, one for each property, stating that it is missing coordinates.
- The Maintenance Hotlist continues to display the work orders from the API, each with its correct, full address.
- The "➡️ Transformed Data for UI" log in the console now reflects the correctly calculated values for `kpiData` and an empty array for `mapData`.
