Replit Agent Prompt:

Objective: Finalize and polish the sidebar/navigation system according to the Canonical Navigation document, with full styling, functional behavior, and visual fidelity. This includes fly-out behavior, icons, routing, and all interaction logic.

‚úÖ Requirements Summary
1. Sidebar Structure & Styling

Match "Canonical Navigation" doc exactly ‚Äî all parents and children must be present.

Fix fly-out behavior when sidebar is collapsed:

Hovering over a parent should show the full fly-out with icon, label, and children.

Children must display clearly and allow click-through.

Collapse Behavior:

Parent and child icons must be visible.

No partial or missing icons on collapse.

Expand Behavior:

Accordion-style: only one section open at a time.

If a child page is active, its parent auto-expands.

Use Altus Gold #ffd400 for:

Active parent section

Active highlight borders

Parent icons

Use Altus Blue #94a3b8 or system-defined soft light-blue for:

Child icons and text

Sidebar background:

Dark Altus primary: #121417

Sidebar width: 280px expanded, 72px collapsed

2. Icons

Add unique Lucide React icons for every parent and child item.

Parents: large, modern, gold

Children: smaller, modern, soft blue

Avoid repetition ‚Äî use semantically meaningful icons per section.

3. Functional Behavior

Persistent collapse state via localStorage

Pin/unpin toggle at bottom of sidebar (not near logo)

On collapse:

Hide text labels

Keep icons

Show expand button

On hover (when collapsed):

Show full fly-out with logo, label, and nested links

Make sure scrolling works smoothly in sidebar when open

4. Brand & Visual Polish

Show Altus Logo prominently:

Top left when expanded

Shrink smoothly to fit top-left inline with icons when collapsed

Sidebar transitions:

0.3s for width

0.2s for hover effects

Text fonts: clean, modern system fonts with emphasis on clarity

5. Routing

Ensure ALL routes from the Canonical doc are present and navigable

Add stub components for any route that lacks a current page (e.g., /growth/sales)

Keep using wouter for routing, no react-router-dom

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Guidance

Files to update:

Sidebar.tsx

navConfig.ts

theme.css

App.tsx (for routing stubs)

Icons: use Lucide

Ensure all components are functional in both desktop and responsive views

üîÅ Deliverable

The navigation system should:

Render reliably

Fly out perfectly on hover

Show/hide properly on collapse

Auto-expand based on active route

Feature complete Canonical Navigation hierarchy

Match Altus design polish

Once complete, tell me:
‚Äú‚úÖ Canonical Navigation implemented and polished successfully.‚Äù
Also provide a list of all icons used per section for review.
