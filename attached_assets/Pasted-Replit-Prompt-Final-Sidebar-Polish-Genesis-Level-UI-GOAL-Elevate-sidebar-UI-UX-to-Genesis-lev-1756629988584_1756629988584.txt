Replit Prompt: Final Sidebar Polish + Genesis-Level UI
🎯 GOAL: Elevate sidebar UI/UX to Genesis-level polish based on the Canonical Navigation Bible (provided), resolving critical issues and aligning with final branding/design expectations.

---

📌 **1. Sidebar Iconography (Parent + Child)**
- ✅ Apply *unique Lucide icons* to **all parent items**, currently missing.
- ✅ Ensure **both parent and child icons** are always visible in expanded view.
- ✅ In collapsed state, **child icons must display properly** and **differ in color** (light blue `#94a3b8`) from parents (gold `#ffd400`).

📌 **2. Sidebar Visual Design**
- Fix text color for parent items in expanded sidebar: currently too dark, use `#e5e7eb` or white for high visibility.
- Logo is **too small** in both collapsed and expanded states:
  - Expanded: 48px height
  - Collapsed: 32px icon centered
  - Ensure smooth resize animation
- Logo should be **brighter/more visible** against black: add glow or invert filter.

📌 **3. Flyout Functionality**
- 🔁 Rebuild flyout panel from scratch:
  - Trigger on hover when sidebar is collapsed
  - Should show full **section name and children**
  - **Flyout width max 280px** — DO NOT let it overflow full screen
  - Animate in/out using `transform: translateX()` and `opacity` transition (0.2s)

📌 **4. Sidebar Collapse / Expand Polish**
- Active state for parents needs highlighting (`#ffd400` border left)
- When collapsed:
  - Icons remain, text hidden
  - Mouse hover reveals flyout
  - **Pin state** persists across reload (use `localStorage`)
- Fix icon hover behavior: subtle background highlight + fade transition

📌 **5. Table Display Bug**
- 🐛 Table content (e.g. Properties) is squished under orphaned column when sidebar is open.
- Ensure correct `grid` or `flex` layout structure:
  - `main` should use `margin-left` or `grid-template-columns` to respect sidebar width
  - Sidebar must not overlap or push content off-screen

📌 **6. Typography & Animation Cleanup**
- Update all font sizes to match design hierarchy:
  - Sidebar section label: `11px`, uppercase, letter spacing `1px`
  - Child text: `14px`, normal case
- Transitions:
  - Width transitions: `0.3s`
  - Flyout panel: `transform` + `opacity` `0.2s`
  - Logo scaling: `0.3s ease-in-out`

📌 **7. Accessibility & Keyboard**
- Add `aria-expanded` to collapsible elements
- Keyboard navigation: `Tab` to navigate, `Enter` to expand sections
- Focus ring (outline) on nav items: `outline: 2px solid #ffd400`

📌 **8. Integrate Canonical Navigation**
- Use uploaded file **Canonical Navigation (Markdown).docx** to:
  - Match all section titles
  - Match correct order of parents and children
  - Ensure proper routing in `App.tsx` for each path
- Validate all routes: Dashboard, Portfolio V3, Cards, Operations, Growth, System, Data Management, Investor Portal, Integrations

💡 GENERAL NOTES:
- We’re aiming for **production-grade UI**, clean animation, responsive behavior, and fully modern interaction patterns.
- You may use Tailwind or CSS Modules for styling.
- Avoid regression: test expanded and collapsed views, flyouts, and all navigation paths
