SYSTEM / PLAN (Do, don’t ask)
Scope:
- Owner Transfer pages (both)
- Toast container
- Any nested scroll regions that can cause double scroll
- Do not change business logic

Tasks:

1) ToastContainer: make it non-blocking
- File: src/components/ui/ToastContainer.tsx (or wherever it lives)
- Wrap the root container with `pointer-events-none` and give each toast `pointer-events-auto` so clicks pass through when not over a toast.
- Keep it `fixed bottom-4 right-4` but set `z-[40]` (not 50) to avoid overlaying dropdown portals.

2) Single scroll owner layout
- Files:
  - src/features/owners/pages/OwnerTransferPage.tsx
  - src/features/owners/pages/OwnerTransferDetailPage.tsx
- Replace `min-h-[calc(100vh-64px)] overflow-y-auto` on the main container with EXACTLY:
  `className="h-[calc(100vh-64px)] overflow-y-auto"`
- Ensure the page wrapper above it uses `overflow-hidden` so only one scroll area exists.

3) Limit inner list scroll heights
- In OwnerTransferPage.tsx:
  - Owner search dropdown container: use `max-h-[50vh] overflow-y-auto`.
  - Property selection list: use `max-h-[50vh] overflow-y-auto`.
- In TransferDryRun.tsx:
  - Keep sticky thead, but change `max-h-96` to `max-h-[60vh] overflow-y-auto`.

4) Verify portals/z-index for dropdowns and typeaheads
- Ensure any popover/dropdown uses a portal container with `z-[60]` so it renders above cards and below toasts.
- If using Radix or Headless UI, set the Portal container class to `z-[60]`.

5) Navigation: Systems → Integrations → Health
- Confirm the nav item renders (it’s defined). If tree state is collapsed by default, expand Systems by default in the Sidebar component (only initial state). Do not hardcode it always open; store initial open state in localStorage key `ecc.nav.openGroups` if already implemented.

Deliverables:
- Diff showing the changed classNames and any small CSS adjustments
- Confirm via screenshots:
  - Owner Transfer page shows no overlays blocking content
  - No double scrollbars
  - Typeahead dropdown clickable
  - Systems → Integrations → Health visible and navigable
- Do not alter data fetching or endpoint URLs.
