You are in PLAN (audit-only) then BUILD (apply) mode as directed.

GOAL
Confirm the UI now talks to the working Azure stubs and fix any viewport/scroll blocking on Owner pages.

TASKS
1) Environment sanity
- Print out `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL` at runtime (console on app mount).
- Confirm it equals: https://empirecommandcenter-altus-staging.azurewebsites.net
- If not, set it in Replit Secrets and rebuild.

2) Network verification (DevTools console)
- Visit these routes and log each first network response body and status:
  /card/property/42
  /card/unit/45
  /card/lease/1
  /card/tenant/1
  /card/owner/1
  /owners/transfer
  /owners/transfer?id=1
- Verify `fetchEntity()` tries path param first then query-param fallback. With the new backend, path-param should return 200 immediately.

3) Owner Transfer smoke
- On /owners/transfer, use the Source/Target typeaheads:
  - Type “Altus” → expect GET /api/owners/search?q=Altus → 200 with items array.
- Click “Initiate Transfer”:
  - Expect POST /api/owners/initiateTransfer → 200; capture transferId=T-1 in logs.
- Click “Approve”:
  - Expect POST /api/owners/approveTransfer → 401 first (no token).
  - Then add header via our api helper using ADMIN token from env (already wired) and confirm 200.

4) Fix viewport/scroll blocking
- Make these exact edits:
  a) src/components/ui/ToastContainer.tsx
     - Wrap the fixed container with `pointer-events-none`.
     - Each toast card inside should add `pointer-events-auto`.
     - Keep `z-50`.
  b) src/features/owners/pages/OwnerTransferPage.tsx and OwnerTransferDetailPage.tsx
     - Change top-level `<main>` from `min-h-[calc(100vh-64px)] overflow-y-auto`
       to `min-h-screen overflow-y-visible`.
     - Ensure the page wrapper (not body) controls scrolling: the body should not.
  c) In OwnerTransferPage.tsx:
     - For the owner search dropdown and property list, keep the max-heights but ensure they’re inside a non-scroll main by using `overflow-y-auto` only on the list containers, not the page wrapper.

5) Commit message
"fix(ui): unblocked owner pages; enable pointer-events for toasts; standardize page scroll; confirmed Azure stubs 200s"

OUTPUTS
- Paste console logs showing 200s from all endpoints above.
- Confirm owner transfer buttons perform the expected requests and statuses (401→200 with admin token).
- Confirm no double scrollbars and owner page content fully visible.
