## Database Schema

The feature adds three new tables to the database:

### `owner_transfers`
- `id` - Serial primary key
- `property_ids` - Array of property IDs being transferred
- `new_owner_id` - Reference to new owner
- `old_owner_id` - Reference to previous owner
- `effective_date` - Transfer effective date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `status` - Transfer status (PENDING_ACCOUNTING, APPROVED_ACCOUNTING, READY_EXECUTION, COMPLETE)
- `notes` - Optional transfer notes
- `initiated_by` - User who initiated the transfer
- `executed_at` - Timestamp when transfer was completed
- `created_at` / `updated_at` - Standard timestamps

### `owner_transfer_snapshots`
- `id` - Serial primary key
- `transfer_id` - Reference to owner transfer
- `entity_type` - Type of entity (property, unit, lease, tenant, workorder)
- `entity_id` - ID of the snapshotted entity
- `raw_jsonb` - Complete JSON snapshot of entity state
- `created_at` - Snapshot creation time

### `audit_events`
- `id` - Serial primary key
- `event_type` - Type of event (OWNER_TRANSFER_INIT, OWNER_TRANSFER_COMPLETE, etc.)
- `entity_type` - Type of entity affected
- `entity_id` - ID of affected entity
- `actor_id` - User who performed the action
- `payload` - JSON payload with additional context
- `created_at` - Event timestamp

## Workflow States

1. **PENDING_ACCOUNTING** - Initial state, awaiting accounting review
2. **APPROVED_ACCOUNTING** - Accounting has approved the transfer
3. **READY_EXECUTION** - Admin has authorized execution
4. **COMPLETE** - Transfer has been executed

## User Interface

### Owner Card Page
- Navigate to any owner card page (`/card/owner/{id}`)
- Click the "ðŸ”„ Transfer Ownership" button
- Complete the 4-step workflow

### Transfer Stepper Modal
1. **Select Owner** - Choose new owner and effective date
2. **Set Date** - Review transfer summary
3. **Confirm Entities** - View entity tree that will be affected
4. **Workflow** - Manage approval workflow and execution

## Security & Permissions

- **Initiate**: Any authenticated user
- **Approve Accounting**: Users with accounting role
- **Authorize Execution**: Admin users only
- **Execute**: Admin users only

## Testing

The feature can be tested through:
1. UI workflow via owner card pages
2. Direct API calls using the cURL examples above
3. Database inspection of created records and snapshots

## Notes

- The system creates comprehensive snapshots of all related entities (properties, units, leases, tenants, work orders) when a transfer is initiated
- All state changes are logged in the audit_events table
- DoorLoop integration is optional and controlled by environment variables
- Reports are saved to `/reports/owner_transfers/` directory
- The feature uses the existing project patterns and design system
